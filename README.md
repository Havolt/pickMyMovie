# pickMyMovie

This is an application I created in which the user enters in a handful of films. The application then sorts the films through an API and brings back a film with information to the viewer based on length/rating or at random if the user wishes. 

All visuals on the page are created using the Vue framework.

You can find the app at the following link:
